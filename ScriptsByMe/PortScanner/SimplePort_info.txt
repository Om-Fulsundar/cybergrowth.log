# 🔍 Simple Python Port Scanner
This is a lightweight Python-based TCP port scanner. It uses Python’s built-in `socket` module to check for open ports on a target IP address.

## 🚀 Features
- No external dependencies
- Optional port range selection
- Fast and minimal CLI interface
- Timeout and error handling

### usage :
python3 Portscanner_simple.py <IP> [start_port] [end_port]
### example :
python3 Portscanner_simple.py 192.168.24.1
python3 Portscanner_simple.py 192.168.24.1 1 1000

[start and end ports are optional for input, default it will scan all 1 to 65535 ports.]

⚠️ Note
This is a basic port scanner and does not use multithreading, which may affect scan speed. 
A threaded version with performance improvements will be released as part of the Advanced Port Scanner.
