## 🧪 Network Scanner — ARP-based IP & MAC Discovery 

This script scans a given IP range and lists live hosts with their MAC addresses using Scapy. 

🔧 Dependencies: `scapy`, `prettytable`  
⚠️ Requires root privileges to run

### Usage :
sudo python3 netscan.py

### Working :
When the user provides a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24), the program first crafts ARP packets to discover active hosts.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network. 
Since we don’t know the MAC addresses of the target devices, we send ARP requests to the broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) asking:
"Who has this IP? Tell me your MAC."
We use Scapy’s srp() function to send and receive these packets at Layer 2. If a host responds, we extract its IP and MAC address and store them in a dictionary.
Finally, we use PrettyTable to display the results in a clean, readable table format.
